System Norms Configuration File for Debug GUI
--------------------------------------------
This file contains the normal operating ranges and warning thresholds
for the physical parameters monitored in the debug GUI.

Each parameter has:
- normal_min, normal_max: The range for normal operation (displayed in green)
- warning_min, warning_max: The range for warning level (displayed in yellow)
- Values outside warning range are considered critical (displayed in red)

These values should be adjusted according to the specific requirements
of the hardware being tested.
